# US Airline Performance & Flight Delay Analysis (2015)

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of US domestic commercial airlines throughout 2015. Using a dataset of over 800,000 flights, this analysis investigates trends in flight volume, departure delays, and cancellations. The ultimate goal is to present key observations and actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard, highlighting the factors that impact airline reliability and operational efficiency.

## Dataset

The [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kll43rUiEwkIsowC1xoFVmZ_H-jLs5r9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108405867980293701725&rtpof=true&sd=true) contains records for more than 800,000 commercial airline flights in the US for the year 2015. Each record represents a single flight and includes detailed information such as:
*   Airline Name and Flight Number
*   Origin & Destination Airports
*   Flight Distance
*   Scheduled vs. Actual Departure and Arrival Times
*   Delay & Cancellation Data

## Key Analytical Questions

The analysis for this project seeks to answer the following key questions:

1.  How does the overall flight volume vary on a monthly basis?
2.  What percentage of flights experienced a departure delay, and what was the average duration of these delays?
3.  How does the percentage of delayed flights fluctuate throughout the year?
4.  What was the total number of cancelled flights in 2015, and what were the primary drivers for cancellation (e.g., weather, airline-related issues)?
5.  Which airlines were the most and least reliable in terms of on-time departures?

## Tools & Technologies
